How does artificial intelligence (AI) change the practice of
contemporary authorship? The recent success of generative AI has
precipitated a lively discussion about technology and creativity.
Intelligence itself has been brought into question as a property of
humans or complex systems. However, the very idea of (seemingly)
autonomous computer authorship contains within it also a paradox and a
logical fallacy. The notion of an "artificial" author implies the
obverse "natural" agent, capable of reasoning, composing, or
communicating without instrumental assistance. Yet, in reflecting on the
instrumental realities of authorship historically, I struggle to find
any such natural quality. Authorship has always involved an appeal to
collective resources. Whether in using a thesaurus or a spell-checker,
an author draws on authorities external and shared. Language can hardly
be imagined otherwise, in a private capacity. At best, I arrange my own
thoughts, words, and paragraphs from prefabricated material. Thus,
before any conversation on AI and authorship can commence, I want to
consider common---perhaps even the most commonplace---modalities of
authorship, beyond the individual. In the following pages, I sketch out
the outlines of a research program that points to an alternate future,
in which AI aligns with, rather than breaks from, its humanistic
traditions.

The figure of an author auteur, an individuated god-like genius creator,
peaked with Romanticism, in the late nineteenth century. Modernist
writers chipped away at the very idea of creative agency: the Soviets
wrote poetry on factory walls in collectives, the French circulated
algorithms for "potential literature," and writers such as the American
Edward Stratemeyer founded whole fiction factories, that authored
popular stories on an industrial scale, in syndicates.

The author was dead, in other words, long before the post-modern nail in
the authorship coffin. Where the topic of authorship has lost some of
its theoretical cache---as judged by a decline in scholarship on the
topic---authorial practices evolved and diversified. Today, we may
routinely watch a television show written by dozens of writers, follow a
social media robot who dabbles in poetry, cite an encyclopedia entry
written by hundreds of contributors, and offer commentary on a literary
work written by a troupe of Sulawesi macaques (Yi Tenen 2017).

The study of authorship thus faces a wilderness of practice, alive and
open to interpretation. I have grouped them into several categories,
mostly as a way to organize my thoughts against the background of
existing research. The first of these---anonymous---takes us into the
vast archive of texts absent the author function. Against this archive,
the presence of a named author seems to be an anomaly rather than the
default it often feigns in literary history. It includes the myriad of
faceless, unsigned texts---and those signed by masked authors, whose
very function is to remove authorial identity from consideration.

Let's begin with an intuition. Were you to teach a class on any
topic---political thought or world literature---and were that class to
include an online discussion component---a blog or a forum---would you
allow your students to contribute anonymously? The answer doesn't come
lightly.

On the one hand, discussion forums benefit from strong personalities. A
comment gains deeper significance when we can connect it to a name: who
wrote this, where, and when? But what is this easy link between
discourse and identity? An opinion "means more" when it is
contextualized within a relationship to a specific person (Abrams 1971).
In the Appendix to his *Concluding Unscientific Postscript to the
Philosophical Fragments*, Søren Kierkegaard wrote, under a pseudonym,
"the whole book is about myself, solely about me, 'I, Joh. Cl., now
thirty years old, born in Copenhagen, a plain, ordinary human like
most.'" The insistence on identity in its absence points to the
existential ambiguity of all writing: an authorial voice can never
equate the person. Authors nevertheless carry what Jean-Paul Sartre
called an incontestable burden of responsibility (Kierkegaard 2009, 16 &
520). The French *l'auteur* surely "must be a misprint for *l'autrui*,
'the Other,'" his English translator added (264). Translation adds to
the burden: "he didn't write it but he would have," or "he probably
meant that" and "he would agree, if he was still alive and present to
elaborate."

On the other hand, anonymity also plays an important social function.
It's good the author isn't here, looking over my shoulder. My
collocutors also may hold views they know to be reprehensible, without
understanding the reasons why. For example, compatriots from the
periphery of the Soviet Union, where I grew up, sometimes express racist
or homophobic opinions. They would like to be convinced otherwise
perhaps, but struggle to begin a discussion on a topic that holds so
much negative connotation. An opportunity to speak anonymously helps
broach a difficult conversation. In the tradition of North American
letters, a discussion about secession in the 1780s took place between
Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay under a pseudonym,
precisely to allow for a controversial and possibly damaging view to
receive its due diligence in public.

Anonymity and pseudonymity constitute a powerful discursive strategy.
The Wu Ming foundation is a pseudonym for a group of Italian writers
responsible for the novel *Q*, first published in Italian in 1999, under
the name of Luther Blissett. The Stratemeyer Syndicate, founded in 1906,
produced numerous best-selling stories as part of the *Nancy Drew*,
*Hardy Boys*, *Tom Swift*, and *Bobbsey Twins* series. Stratemeyer
published hundreds of volumes using dozens of ghost writers. "His"
novels sold in the millions. It is similarly difficult to disentangle
Alexandre Dumas (the senior) from his ghostwriters, including Auguste
Maquet who likely contributed to such popular works as *The Three
Musketeers*, *The Count of Monte-Cristo*, and *Queen Margot*
(Sainte-Beuve 1839; Allen 1979).

At the turn of this century, the activist group Anonymous captured the
public imagination. Anonymous appeals precisely because it is a
collective that expresses itself through an amorphous singular entity.
Everyone can be a member, while nobody in particular is. They derive
authority from a diffuse sense of a faceless commons, where the
individual derives it from a sense of self and identity. Yet the
Anonymous also marks identity, functioning as a signature or a brand for
this particular group, in distinction from other anonymous sources. The
Anonymous usurps anonymity, in the name of a specific political project.

In this last regard, I am particularly interested in following literary
scandals that hinge on the question of authorial identity. "Every so
often a book bursts on the scene and triggers irresistible questions:
Who is the author? What made him a writer? Is the book autobiographical?
Is it fantasy?" so begins the review of the 1999 novel *Sarah*, by J. T.
LeRoy---an HIV-positive teenage boy, later revealed to be a made-up
literary persona of Laura Albert (Texier 2000). In a lawsuit against the
author and her publisher, the attorneys representing Antidote Films, who
bought film rights to the novel, wrote: "The alleged truth behind the
novel created greater sympathy for the novel's narrative character,
Cherry Vanilla, who was supposedly based on 'Leroy' himself" (Antidote
2006). When Leroy turned out to be a pseudonym, the film company sued to
recover what it saw as a loss of value attached to the author's "true"
identity.

Where in some genres, anonymity weakens authenticity, a sense of
authority can also be made stronger through its apparent absence. *The
Economist*---an English-language weekly in print since 1843---famously
omits author bylines. In a column titled "*The Economist* explains
itself," the *Economist* explains:

> \[...\] having started off as a way for one person to give the
> impression of being many, anonymity has since come to serve the
> opposite function at *The Economist*: it allows many writers to speak
> with a collective voice. Leaders \[leading articles\] are discussed
> and debated each week in meetings that are open to all members of the
> editorial staff. Journalists often co-operate on articles. And some
> articles are heavily edited. Accordingly, articles are often the work
> of *The Economist's* hive mind, rather than of a single author.

That sense of a hive mind gives the *Economist* not only a unified sense
of prose style, but also lends it the authority of collective wisdom.
The lack of bylines allows the magazine to maintain a more neutral tone,
claiming a measure of objectivity not available to individual authors.
Authors cannot appeal to fame or status when writing for the
*Economist*. Neither can they derive individual benefit---the prestige
of the journal rests with the collective. Where anonymity undermines
named works like *Sarah*, the anonymity of the *Economist* strengthens
its collective byname.

A similar dynamic reigns on Wikipedia, an epistemic monument to modern
encyclopedia making and a massively collaborative enterprise that covers
more than 26 million articles in more than 250 languages. In an opinion
piece penned in 2005, a prominent critic of online culture summarized
his experience of Wikipedia as follows: "garbage, an incoherent
hodge-podge of dubious factoids \[...\] that adds up to something far
less than the sum of its parts" (Carr 2016, 4). By 2014, a meta-review
of peer-reviewed academic literature on the quality of Wikipedia found
the site exemplary along multiple markers of excellence:
comprehensiveness, currency, readability, and reliability (Mesgari
2015). According to Wikipedia, more than 60 million people have made at
least a small edit to the site, while the number of "active editors" is
estimated to be somewhere around 300,000 (Wikipedia 2024).

What does it mean for millions of people to become authors of a text, an
encyclopedia? The question is by no means unique to new media. Massive
online collaboration plunges us into an ancient, pre-modern tradition of
participatory storytelling: more similar to the tales my grandmother
told me when I was a child; to the mosaic patterns authorship in the Old
Testament, uncovered by source criticism; and to the Homeric tradition
of oral literature, retold, re-lived, and embellished with each
iteration.[^1]

Wikipedia seems like a radically participatory institution: one to which
everyone is welcome to contribute. Research into authorship practices on
Wikipedia reveals hidden complications however. As the project grew, its
participation rates declined (more readers, less writers) due to
increasing and ever-more hierarchical bureaucracy, the exclusion of
newcomers, resistance to new edits, and outright bias. Women account for
less than a quarter of the site's editors. Cultural bias skews the
content to privilege white, urban, North American, English-language,
male, and chauvinist contributors.[^2] Perhaps unsurprisingly, the
products of a collective intelligence reflect the socio-economic
problems of the underlying collective.

The open-ended nature of Wikipedia implies a distributed model of
authorship, one that spans not only multiple human contributors, but
also includes organic, algorithmic, and chance elements of composition.
No longer the fruit of unique authors, a text grows, not unlike a wild
plant. In this sense, certain concepts associated with single-source
authorship no longer apply. The lines between writer and editor blur. We
can find no more "original manuscripts," "autographs," "facsimiles,"
"proofs," or "author corrections." Instead, in the language of software
version control, we find "branches," "revision trees," and "flows"
(O'Donovan and Grimson 1990; Churchill and Snowdon 1998).

In his influential 1995 paper "How a Cockpit Remembers Its Speeds,"
Edwin Hutchins proposed to view complex human endeavors, such as the act
of landing a plane for example, not as products of discrete minds, but
as cognition "extended" or "distributed" across systems: involving
multiple people, flight checklists, and levers and gauges. Similar to a
team of pilots operating a plane, an author within a distributed system
engages in a continual dialog with other authors, automated editorial
algorithms, and the platform itself. To understand authorship in such an
environment one can begin by charting the literal flows of information
between minds (wet-ware), computer programs (software), and
infrastructure (hardware).

The recent success of text-generating algorithms such as GPT-4 and BERT
underscores the necessity for a distributed approach in the study of
authorship. The naive view would understand the algorithm to write
autonomously. At the extreme, we imagine the emergence of
"super-intelligence" capable of independent action. In practice, we find
authorship augmented by powerful tools, as the product of industrial
manufacture, spanning large human collectives. In this way, even the
"simple" action of automated "spelling correction," reveals, under
examination, the involvement of hundreds if not thousands of people in
every ordinary act of writing. The email written with the help of
"canned responses" or "grammar correction" or even generated wholly by
prompt ("respond sternly that I cannot make this meeting"), is no more a
hand-crafted product than the modern automobile. The word processor and
the email client pave the grounds for a factory floor of text
assemblage. The mistake was to ever imagine that the forces of
industrialism would spare intellectual labor.

A page on Wikipedia may similarly reflect the activity of two or more
"bots"---software proxies for author-programmers---engaged in a struggle
for authorial control over an article, with one side vandalizing and the
other upholding the site's editorial standards (Geiger and Ribes 2010).
To conceptualize authorship in this environment one must analyze the
written content, read the code that produced it, examine the rules and
regulations of the community that sanctioned it, and, in an ethnographic
sense, produce a thick description of the platform that frames the
activity. Neither human nor algorithm nor platform constitute authors in
the conventional sense. Rather, authorship emerges in the interaction
between its constituent components.

The causal chain of agency between authors and their works---as it is
reflected in commercial copyright regimes and royalty payment
schemes---can no longer be unambiguously traced to a singular source of
creativity within a system of creation so distributed. For example, the
"Death of the Authors" project by Femke Snelting and the Intelligence
Collective, invited readers to contribute to a public performance of
Anne Frank's diaries (in the original Dutch), in order to liberate it
from the spurious and indefinite copyright claims by the legal entity
which now profits from the work. "By recording a sentence \[from the
diaries\] you contribute to the construction of Anne Frank\'s collective
voice \[...\] Furthermore, the sentences will be donated as training
data for free speech recognition software, like Voxforge, which suffer
from a crucial lack of Dutch spoken language" (Snelting 2015). In this
way, the words of a young girl who perished in the Holocaust become
first a shared memory, then a legal concept in the public domain, then a
chorus of readers, and finally an algorithm, which benefits the language
as a whole.

Why study anonymous or distributed texts, in parallel with their named
counterparts? Whatever is meant by "democratic deliberation," depends
vitally on the questions of authorship, authority, and authenticity.
"The authorship system is broken and may be in need of a radical
solution," the editor of the *British Medical Journal* wrote in response
to the increasingly tangled bylines of medical literature (Smith 1997).
Tim Scott (1997), responded to write that "authorship is a political
problem," and that "it involves staking and maintaining territorial
rights, colonization, and empire building." Ji-Dong Jia (1997), an
associate professor in a Beijing research center, wrote that "in China
only the first author is eligible for promotion." A team of researchers
from Ann Arbor analyzed the differences between similar Japanese- and
English-language medical publications to find significant inter-cultural
variation in authorship attribution, which made comparison between
journals difficult (Fetters and Elwyn 1997). At a smaller scale, I
struggle every semester with the decision of allowing anonymous comments
in my class forum just as democracy at large is yet to assimilate the
incursion of automated author agents into the public sphere.

The study of authorship in the wild fascinates me precisely because it
concerns the essence of humanity: legal, professional, cultural, and
spiritual. At the extreme end of the spectrum, we encounter truly divine
creators---divine in the sense of a design that emerges in the aggregate
of glacial, planetary forces: a single strand of the Deoxyribonucleic
acid molecule (DNA), the visual artifacts of "crown shyness" by which
tree canopies form intricate patterns, typographic "rivers" of white
space between words, and, indeed, life itself. Forms that persist create
patterns no more authored or meaningful than chance arrangements of
autumn leaves on the ground, river tributaries, or the soft patter of
rain, which nevertheless attain significance, however briefly, in the
mind of another author: reader, listener, observer.[^3]
